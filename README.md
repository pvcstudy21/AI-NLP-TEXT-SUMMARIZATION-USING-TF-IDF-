# AI-NLP-TEXT-SUMMARIZATION-USING-TF-IDF-
This project focuses on text summarization by preprocessing text with NLTK for tokenization, stop words removal, and stemming. Feature extraction employs TfidfVectorizer to create a TF-IDF matrix. Sentence scores are stored in a dictionary, with a threshold set by averaging scores. Sentences above this threshold are selected for summarization.
